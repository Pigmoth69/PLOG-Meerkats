Projeto realizado no âmbito da disciplina de Programação em Lógica com apoio de interface gráfica da disciplina de LAIG

## Number of players
2, 3 or 4 players

##Materials

A hexagonal board with 5 hexagons per side, 60 stones in four colors, 15 red, 15 yellow, 15 green and 15 blue.

Four chips in 4 colors red, yellow, green and blue.

You will also need a small drawstring bag.

##Definitions

Group – A set of like color connected stones, a single stone is also considered a group.

##Rules

The board is placed between the players and starts out empty.

Place the 4 chips in a bag and then the youngest player draws a chip and passes the bag to the next player.

After all the chips are drawn players look at their chips without revealing them to the other players.

Chips will remain hidden until the end of the game. 

The color of a chip corresponds to the color of the stones that belong to that player.

The youngest player starts by dropping a stone of any color onto an empty hexagon, then turn moves clockwise.

From now on, each player on his turn must drop 1 stone of any color onto an empty hexagon and then move a different stone already on the board to another empty hexagon.

##Restrictions

- A stone is moved in a straight line in any direction until another stone in its path or the edge of the board blocks it. 

- Stones cannot jump over other stones.

- Conversing with the other players during the game is not allowed.

##Goal

The game ends when 1 of 2 conditions occurs.

1. A player manages to group all of his 15 stones revealing then his chip to the other players as confirmation of his win or
2. When the board is full, players then reveal their chips, the player with the largest group in her color wins.

If two or more players are tied when comparing their largest groups then look at their second largest groups as a tie-breaker.

When playing a 2 or 3 player game the rules are the same as above with but one exception, leave the undrawn chips in the bag.
